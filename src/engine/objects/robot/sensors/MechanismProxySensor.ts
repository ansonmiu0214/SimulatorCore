 * Simulated Sensor on mechanism
 *
 * This is a {@link SimBasicSensor} which is part of a mechanism.
 *
 * This sensor is not inteneded to be added to the robot itself, but is instead added as a side
 * effect of adding the mechanism to the robot.
 *
 * When this sensor object is read from, it forwards the request to the mechanism which answers for it.
 *
 * This is abstracted away from the robot interface which is able to read values from the robot.
